    The following SPICE-related options are added to the ``spice``
    configuration group of a Nova configuration:
    
    - image_compression
    - jpeg_compression
    - zlib_compression
    - playback_compression
    - streaming_mode
    
    These options can be used to enable and set the SPICE compression
    settings for libvirt (QEMU/KVM) provisioned instances. Note that those
    options are only taken into account if SPICE support is enabled (and
    the VNC support is disabled). By default, these configuration options
    are set to libvirt's default values.
