    The new image metadata properties ``hw_video_ram_bar1``,
    ``hw_video_ram_bar2_ext``, and ``hw_video_ram_vga``, have been added.
    These properties can be used to specify the video RAM to provide for the
    primary bar, the secondary bar extension (64 bit) and the VGA framebuffer
    of a QXL graphics adapter on compute nodes using the libvirt virt driver.
    All three properties are limited by the new flavors extra specifications
    ``hw_video:ram_bar1_max_mb``, ``hw_video:ram_bar2_ext_max_mb``, and
    ``hw_video:ram_vga_max_mb``. Note that video RAM values for all three
    properties and limits are specified in MB. If an image property from above
    is used, make sure that its corresponding limit is set in a referenced
    flavor; otherwise, a runtime error occurs during instance creation.
